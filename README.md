# Turn Based game 

<p>Technology used to create this project: Java</p>
<p>This was created in order to learn even more about OOP, and design a future concept for a game.</p>
<br>
<p>So far, 2 users can play the game - they can create their own character, and select a class (Knight, Barbarian, Mage and Paladin) in order to duel.</p>

<p>The whole game can be played through the terminal. You can install this project in your machine as well - and don't need to install any dependencies/libraries.</p>
